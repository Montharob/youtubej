    <h3>ðŸ’„Bobbi Brown cosmetic brand was founded by an American woman named Bobbi Brown, just like the brand name. In those days, she had a career as a makeup artist and writer, who in the 1990s she designed 10 shades of lipstick, which are natural shades to meet all forms of beauty. Only 100 lipsticks were produced in the first lot and she aimed to sell them all within a month, but the response was better than expected. Because the first Bobbi Brown lipstick was sold out in just one day, it was Bobbi Brown's first success.
ðŸ’„When Bobbi Brown successfully hit the lipstick market The following year, she invented a yellow tone foundation. which must be said that it was still very new in that era She came up with the idea that makeup is not just a coating of cosmetics on the face, but must be balanced and compatible with our true skin tone as well. As expected, Bobbi Brown's foundation has been as great as ever. It is another success that Bobbi Brown was able to create foundation to be another great item that can easily become popular in the market.

Although Bobbi Brown was well received, it was still a relatively new brand at the time. But thanks to Bobbi Brown's prominence in products and innovative cosmetic innovation, EstÃ©e Lauder Companies Inc. decided to negotiate the acquisition of Bobbi Brown in 1995, but Bobbi Brown continued to operate. And with more investment, along with more equipment and personnel, Bobbi Brown has been able to continue to release new products to the world market. Bobbi Brown's sales account for 10% of all EstÃ©e Lauder products.
For the first cool item from the brand Bobbi Brown is VITAMIN ENRICHED FACE BASE, although it has been launched for a few years. but has gained immense popularity Because it is a pre-makeup skin preparation product that is merged with many vitamins that will make your face full, soft, bouncy. Adjust the skin to be consistent so that the makeup can last longer and be more beautiful.</h3>
